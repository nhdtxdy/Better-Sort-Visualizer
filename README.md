# Better-Sort-Visualizer

Inspired by [the original sort visualizer](https://www.sortvisualizer.com/), this project adds the functionality to visually compare the sorting algorithms against each other, along with the possibility to manually change the sample size and animation speed, all available in a new, aesthetically pleasing user interface.
