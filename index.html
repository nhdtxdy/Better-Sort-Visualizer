However, it is not very efficient for large lists and can be outperformed by more advanced sorting algorithms."></p>

It was designed to be faster than other sorting algorithms like bubble sort and selection sort, and it quickly became one of the most widely used algorithms due to its speed and simplicity. In fact, quick sort is still used today in many applications, from database management to operating systems."></p>

It is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides a list into smaller sub-lists, sorts those sub-lists, and then merges them back together to produce a sorted list. Merge sort is a stable sort, meaning that it preserves the relative order of equal elements in the sorted list.
